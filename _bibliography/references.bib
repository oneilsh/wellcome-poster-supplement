                   a textual dataset based on the ICD-10-CM code descriptions,
                   widely used in US hospitals and containing many clinical
                   terms, and their easily reproducible rephrasing. We then
                   benchmarked existing embedding models, either generalist or
                   specialized in the clinical domain, in a semantic search task

               efficacy are moderated by an interaction of age and gender.
               METHODS: A pooled dataset from eight randomized, controlled
               trials of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) was
               reanalyzed to compare remission rates following therapy with
               venlafaxine (n = 851), one of several selective serotonin
               reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (n = 748), or placebo (n = 446).
               Remission was defined as a final Hamilton Rating Scale for
               Depression (HAM-D) score or =50). Among older women, the impact
               of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on remission rates also was

               not affected by age, sex, or HRT use. Among women, but not men,
               there was a significant interaction reflecting poorer SSRI
               response in the older age group (Wald chi-square = 4.21, df = 1,
               p = 0.04); HRT appeared to eliminate this difference. Whereas the
               advantage in remission rates favoring venlafaxine was modest for
               men and younger women (6\%-9\%), the difference among older women
               not taking HRT was 23\%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide

               diagnosed with new-onset psychiatric disease following a
               diagnosis of acute COVID-19. However, it was unclear whether

               COVID-19 was performed to evaluate whether non-psychiatric
               PASC-AMs are associated with new-onset psychiatric disease. Data
               were obtained from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C),
               which has EHR data from 76 clinical organizations. EHR codes were

               PASC-AMs in seven categories was assessed by logistic regression.
               There were significant associations between a diagnosis of any

               from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 (GBD) database, this study
               assessed trends in the incidence and prevalence of anxiety
               disorders, depression, and schizophrenia in countries with
               different SDI levels from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint and periodic

               potential to play a crucial role in enhancing health care quality
               by providing evidence-based information to clinicians at the
               point of care. Despite their increasing popularity, there is a
               lack of comprehensive research exploring their design
               characterization and trends. This limits our understanding and
               ability to optimize their functionality, usability, and adoption
               in health care settings. Objective: This systematic review
               examined the design characteristics of CDSS from a user-centered
               perspective, focusing on user-centered design (UCD), user
               experience (UX), and usability, to identify related design
               challenges and provide insights into the implications for future
               design of CDSS. Methods: This review followed the PRISMA
               (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
               Meta-Analyses) recommendations and used a grounded theory
               analytical approach to guide the conduct, data analysis, and
               synthesis. A search of 4 major electronic databases (PubMed, Web
               of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore) was conducted for papers
               published between 2013 and 2023, using predefined design-focused
               keywords (design, UX, implementation, evaluation, usability, and
               architecture). Papers were included if they focused on a designed
               CDSS for a health condition and discussed the design and UX
               aspects (eg, design approach, architecture, or integration).
               Papers were excluded if they solely covered technical
               implementation or architecture (eg, machine learning methods) or
               were editorials, reviews, books, conference abstracts, or study
               protocols. Results: Out of 1905 initially identified papers, 40
               passed screening and eligibility checks for a full review and
               analysis. Analysis of the studies revealed that UCD is the most
               widely adopted approach for designing CDSS, with all design
               processes incorporating functional or usability evaluation
               mechanisms. The CDSS reported were mainly clinician-facing and
               mostly stand-alone systems, with their design lacking
               consideration for integration with existing clinical information
               systems and workflows. Through a UCD lens, four key categories of
               challenges relevant to CDSS design were identified: (1) usability
               and UX, (2) validity and reliability, (3) data quality and
               assurance, and (4) design and integration complexities. Notably,
               a subset of studies incorporating Explainable artificial
               intelligence highlighted its emerging role in addressing key
               challenges related to validity and reliability by fostering
               explainability, transparency, and trust in CDSS recommendations,
               while also supporting collaborative validation with users.
               Conclusions: While CDSS show promise in enhancing health care
               delivery, identified challenges have implications for their
               future design, efficacy, and utilization. Adopting pragmatic UCD
               design approaches that actively involve users is essential for
               enhancing usability and addressing identified UX challenges.
               Integrating with clinical systems is crucial for interoperability
               and presents opportunities for AI-enabled CDSS that rely on large
               patient data. Incorporating emerging technologies such as
               Explainable Artificial Intelligence can boost trust and
               acceptance. Enabling functionality for CDSS to support both
               clinicians and patients can create opportunities for effective
               use in virtual care.",

               enhanced diagnostic precision, risk stratification, and treatment
               planning. AI models remain a barrier to clinical adoption,
               emphasizing the critical role of explainable AI (XAI). Methods:
               This systematic meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 62
               peer-reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, examining
               the use of XAI methods within CDSSs across various clinical
               domains, including radiology, oncology, neurology, and critical
               care. Model-agnostic techniques such as visualization models like
               Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
               attention mechanisms dominated in imaging and sequential data
               tasks. Results: However, there are still gaps in user-friendly
               evaluation, methodological transparency, and ethical issues, as
               seen by the absence of research that evaluated explanation
               fidelity, clinician trust, or usability in real-world settings.
               In order to enable responsible AI implementation in healthcare,
               our analysis emphasizes the necessity of longitudinal clinical

               in non-psychiatric settings, but the determinants of initial
               choice of antidepressant treatment in these settings are unclear.
               We investigate how non-psychiatrists choose among four
               antidepressant classes at first prescription (selective serotonin
               reuptake inhibitors [SSRI], bupropion, mirtazapine, or
               serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRI]). METHOD:
               Using electronic health records (EHRs), we included adult
               patients at the time of first antidepressant prescription with a
               co-occurring diagnosis code for a depressive disorder. We
               selected 64 variables based on a literature search and expert
               consultation, constructed the variables from either structured
               codes or through applying natural language processing (NLP), and
               modeled antidepressant choice using multinomial logistic
               regression, using SSRI as the reference class. RESULTS: With
               47,528 patients, we observed significant associations for 36 of
               64 variables. Many of these associations suggested
               antidepressants' known pharmacological properties/actions guided
               choice. For example, there was a decreased likelihood of
               bupropion prescription among patients with epilepsy (adjusted OR
               0.49, 95\%CI: 0.41-0.57, p < 0.001), and an increased likelihood
               of mirtazapine prescription among patients with insomnia
               (adjusted OR 1.59, 95\%CI: 1.40-1.80, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
               Broadly speaking, non-psychiatrists' selection of antidepressant
               class appears to be at least in part guided by clinically
               relevant pharmacological considerations.",

               significant heterogeneity in treatment response, with
               inflammation hypothesized to play a role in its pathophysiology.
               Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, such as the
               neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein
               (CRP), may predict antidepressant efficacy. This study
               investigated the association between baseline inflammatory
               biomarkers, their changes, and antidepressant treatment outcomes
               in patients with MDD. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort
               study in Qatar recruited 123 MDD outpatients (aged 18-64).
               Baseline assessments included NLR, CRP, monocyte-to-lymphocyte
               ratio (MLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Depression
               severity was measured via the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale
               (ZSRS) at baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment. Statistical
               analyses, including multiple regression and Random Forest machine
               learning models, identified predictors of antidepressant
               response. RESULTS: Improvement in depressive symptoms was
               associated with female sex, higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV),
               lower absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and higher eosinophil
               counts. However, changes in NLR, MLR, PLR, and CRP did not
               predict treatment response. Folate levels and PLR were identified
               by the machine learning model as top predictors, suggesting
               potential utility as biomarkers for response classification. Our
               study identified predictors of improvement in suicidal ideation,
               including hematological markers (lower RBC, higher eosinophils,
               lower monocytes), younger age, female sex, medical comorbidities,
               and longer assessment intervals. CONCLUSION: Baseline ANC and
               eosinophil count may help stratify MDD treatment outcomes, though
               post-treatment biomarker changes were not linked to symptom
               improvement. Our findings highlight suicidality as a distinct
               pathology within depression, necessitating tailored

               affecting 1 in 7 women after childbirth that is often
               underscreened and underdetected. If not diagnosed and treated,
               PPD is associated with long-term developmental challenges in the
               child and maternal morbidity. Wearable technologies, such as
               smartwatches and fitness trackers (eg, Fitbit), offer continuous
               and longitudinal digital phenotyping for mood disorder diagnosis
               and monitoring, with device wear time being an important yet
               understudied aspect. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to suggest that wear
               time of a wearable device may provide additional information
               about perinatal mental health to facilitate screening and early
               detection of PPD. We proposed that wear time of a wearable device
               may also be valuable for managing other mental health disorders.
               METHODS: Using the All of Us Research Program dataset, we
               identified females who experienced childbirth with and without
               PPD using computational phenotyping. We compared the percentage
               of days and number of hours per day females with and without PPD
               wore Fitbit devices during prepregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum,
               and PPD periods, determined by electronic health records.
               Comparisons between females with and without PPD were conducted
               using linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation
               between Fitbit wear time consistency (measured as the maximum
               number of consecutive days the Fitbit was worn) during
               prepregnancy and PPD periods in females with and without PPD
               using the Pearson correlation. All analyses were run with
               Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Our findings showed a strong
               trend, although nonsignificant after multiple testing correction,
               that females in the PPD cohort wore their Fitbits more than those
               in non-PPD cohort during the postpartum (PPD cohort: mean 69.9\%,
               95\% CI 42.7\%-97\%; non-PPD cohort: mean 50\%, 95\% CI
               25.5\%-74.4\%; P=.02) and PPD periods (PPD cohort: mean 66.6\%,
               95\% CI 37.9\%-95.3\%; non-PPD cohort: mean 46.4\%, 95\% CI
               20.5\%-72.2\%; P=.02). We found no difference in the number of
               hours per day females in the PPD and non-PPD cohorts wore their
               Fitbit during any period of pregnancy. Finally, there was no
               relationship between the consistency of Fitbit wear time during
               prepregnancy and PPD periods (r=-0.05, 95\% CI -0.46 to 0.38;
               P=.84); however, there was a trend, though nonsignificant, in
               Fitbit wear time consistency among females without PPD (r=0.25,
               95\% CI -0.02 to 0.49; P=.07). CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that
               increased Fitbit wear time among females with PPD may be
               attributed to hypervigilance, given the common co-occurrence of
               anxiety symptoms. Future studies should assess the link between
               PPD, hypervigilance, and wear time patterns. We envision that
               wear time patterns of a wearable device combined with digital
               biomarkers such as sleep and physical activity could enhance
               early PPD detection using machine learning by alerting clinicians
               to potential concerns and facilitating timely screenings, which
               may have implications for other mental health disorders.",

               consist of patient information such as demographics, medications,
               laboratory test results, diagnosis codes, and procedures. Mining
               EHRs could lead to improvement in patient health management as
               EHRs contain detailed information related to disease prognosis
               for large patient populations. In this article, we provide a
               structured and comprehensive overview of data mining techniques
               for modeling EHRs. We first provide a detailed understanding of
               the major application areas to which EHR mining has been applied
               and then discuss the nature of EHR data and its accompanying
               challenges. Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR
               mining, the metrics associated with EHRs, and the various study
               designs. With this foundation, we then provide a systematic and
               methodological organization of existing data mining techniques
               used to model EHRs and discuss ideas for future research.",

              pregnant and postpartum women, which has increased since the
              COVID-19 pandemic, making rapidly identifying affected women a
              high clinical priority. While screening tools like the Edinburgh
              Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) are widely used, brevity is
              important for busy clinical practice to reduce administration time
              and patient burden. Current methods to shorten assessments rely on
              traditional psychometric approaches, rather than machine learning
              (ML) methods that could optimize predictive accuracy. Methods We
              developed an ML framework using National Clinical Cohort
              Collaborative (N3C) data to predict full 10-item EPDS scores from
              shortened question subsets (n=22,924). We evaluated all 2-5 item
              combinations using linear regression, validating performance
              across multiple cohorts including postpartum women (n=7,750) and
              external pregnancy populations (n=1,217). For additional
              validation, we applied our approach to the PHQ-9 (n=398,606) to
              test generalizability. Binary classification models using clinical
              thresholds (≥13) determined EPDS screening accuracy. Decision
              curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical utility of our
              ML method. Results The optimal 2-question EPDS combinations Q4+Q8
              (anxiety/sadness) and Q5+Q8 (scared/sadness) both achieved
              R2=0.70. Binary classification demonstrated strong performance
              (sensitivity=0.68-0.72, specificity=0.98-0.99). The framework
              generalized across postpartum subsets, external pregnancy cohorts,
              and PHQ-9 validation (R2=0.64-0.73). Adding covariates did not
              improve performance. Decision curve analysis showed our ML
              approach had superior clinical benefit (0.01-0.03) versus
              traditional additive scoring. Conclusion/Implications Our ML
              framework suggests a reduced assessment burden with two EPDS
              questions maintains predictive accuracy as the full-item EPDS.
              With ∼3.6 million annual U.S. births, this approach could identify
              additional positive perinatal depression screens, enhancing
              screening implementation across clinical settings.",

               to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and
               growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to
               personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches
               from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger
               volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift
               away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific
               hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a
               predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this
               paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict
               treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and
               psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological
               treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are
               being used for the development of predictive models based on
               machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone
               and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from

               Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate

               posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer
               science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a
               nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of

               human, social, and contextual factors that impact the successful
               implementation and user adoption of AI-empowered CDSS (AI-CDSS).
               With the growing interest in human-centered design and evaluation

               of how AI-empowered CDSS was used, designed, and evaluated, and
               how clinician users perceived such systems. We performed
               literature search in five databases for articles published
               between the years 2011 and 2022. A total of 19874 articles were

               Such models, trained over horizontally or vertically partitioned
               data, present a challenge for explainable AI because the
               explaining party may have a biased view of background data or a

               obtained from different participants of distributed machine

               longstanding concerns about ``black box'' models. ``Black box''
               is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they
               are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans. Lack of
               interpretability in predictive models can undermine trust in
               those models, especially in health care, in which so many
               decisions are- literally-life and death issues. There has been a
               recent explosion of research in the field of explainable machine
               learning aimed at addressing these concerns. The promise of
               explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important
               for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical
               decision-support tools or novel research papers to have critical
               understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This
               paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of

               concepts reviewed include interpretability vs explainability and
               global vs local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include
               permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local
               interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence

               approximations may omit important information about how black-box
               models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by
               proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use

              discussed from clinical and data science perspectives. Integration

               of two very differently-run countries: The United States (US)
               that owns the largest private healthcare system in the world, and
               the United Kingdom (UK) that has the largest public healthcare
               system worldwide. The paper specifically focuses on the
               differences between the two countries' adoption of electronic
               healthcare record (EHR) systems, and their efforts toward
               interoperability, healthcare information security and privacy,
               and patient safety. Both authors on the paper are professionals
               in the HIT field and have firsthand experience designing and
               implementing electronic health record (EHR) systems. As a result,
               they both have a real-world grasp of HIT economics and the
               pressure of regulatory compliance. To complement their combined
               expertise and insight, the authors thoroughly reviewed the
               peer-reviewed and grey literature on healthcare policy. The
               paper's findings suggest that although EHR implementation and
               adoption are on the rise in the US and the UK alike, both
               countries are facing considerable hurdles in executing their
               vision of establishing their respective nationwide EHR systems.

               aimed to examine the prevalence and patterns of antidepressant
               switching in the UK, and identify associated demographic and
               clinical factors. METHOD: Cohort analysis of antidepressant
               prescribing data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a
               large, anonymised UK primary care database. The sample included
               262,844 patients who initiated antidepressant therapy between 1
               January 2005 and 31 June 2011. RESULTS: 9.3\% of patients
               switched to a different antidepressant product, with most
               switches (60\%) occurring within 8 weeks of the index date. The
               proportion switching was similar for selective serotonin reuptake
               inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants and other
               antidepressants (9.3\%, 9.8\% and 9.2\%, respectively). Most
               switches were to an SSRI (64.5\%), and this was the preferred
               option regardless of initial antidepressant class. Factors
               predictive of switching included male gender, age, and history of
               self-harm and psychiatric illness. CONCLUSION: Over one in every
               11 patients who initiates antidepressant therapy will switch
               medication, suggesting that initial antidepressant treatment has
               been unsatisfactory. Evidence to guide choice of second-line
               treatment for individual patients is currently limited.

              challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing.
              Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are
              largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine
              learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale
              data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we
              introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open
              science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from
              many centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Clinical and
              Translational Science Award Program and scientific community
              created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and
              governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level
              clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and
              harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a
              secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and
              reproducible collaborative analytics. RESULTS: Organized in
              inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance
              for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to
              identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19
              cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to
              create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data
              enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics
              tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to
              democratize data access. CONCLUSIONS: The N3C has demonstrated
              that a multisite collaborative learning health network can
              overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure
              incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19
              analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid
              collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists
              to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the

               conditions internationally. In recent years, new generation
               antidepressant medicines have become very widely prescribed.
               While these medicines are efficacious, side effects are common
               and frequently result in discontinuation of treatment. Compared
               with specific pharmacological properties of the different
               medications, the relevance of individual vulnerability is
               understudied. Methods: We used data from the Australian Genetics
               of Depression Study to gain insights into the aetiology and
               genetic risk factors to antidepressant side effects. To this end,
               we employed structural equation modelling, polygenic risk scoring
               and regressions. Results: Here we show that participants
               reporting a specific side effect for one antidepressant are more
               likely to report the same side effect for other antidepressants,
               suggesting the presence of shared individual or pharmacological
               factors. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression associated
               with side effects that overlapped with depressive symptoms,
               including suicidality and anxiety. Body Mass Index PRS are
               strongly associated with weight gain from all medications. PRS
               for headaches are associated with headaches from sertraline.
               Insomnia PRS show some evidence of predicting insomnia from
               amitriptyline and escitalopram. Conclusions: Our results suggest
               a set of common factors underlying the risk for antidepressant
               side effects. These factors seem to be partly explained by
               genetic liability related to depression severity and the nature
               of the side effect. Future studies on the genetic aetiology of
               side effects will enable insights into their underlying
               mechanisms and the possibility of risk stratification and

               focuses and forecasts on the distribution of these disorders
               across regions, age groups, genders, and time periods. METHODS:
               We estimated the global burden of anxiety and depressive
               disorders from 1990 to 2021 using data from the Global Burden of
               Disease (GBD) 2021 study. Prevalence, disability-adjusted life
               years (DALYs), and regional trends were analyzed using Joinpoint
               regression, and projections for 2022-2040 were made with the
               Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. Decomposition
               analysis examined the impacts of population growth, aging, and
               epidemiological changes. FINDINGS: In 2021, global prevalence of
               anxiety and depressive disorders reached 359.2 million and 332.4
               million cases, respectively, accounting for 9.1 \% of all
               diseases and 63.1 \% of mental health disorders. Middle and low
               SDI contributed the majority of global cases and DALYs. Between
               1990 and 2021, the age-standardised DALY rate (ASDR) for anxiety
               disorders increased by 18.2 \% and for depressive disorders by
               13.4 \%. Population growth accounted for the majority of this
               increase. The prevalence of these disorders rises with age,
               particularly in the 10-24 age group, with females experiencing
               higher rates. By 2040, global cases are projected to over 515
               million for anxiety and over 466 million for depressive
               disorders, with middle and low SDI contributing the majority of
               cases. CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of anxiety and depressive
               continues to grow, with significant increases in middle and low

                   interpretable models, machine learning models that are

                   show that large language models (LLMs) are remarkably good at
                   working with interpretable models, too. In particular, we
                   show that LLMs can describe, interpret, and debug Generalized
                   Additive Models (GAMs). Combining the flexibility of LLMs
                   with the breadth of statistical patterns accurately described
                   by GAMs enables dataset summarization, question answering,
                   and model critique. LLMs can also improve the interaction
                   between domain experts and interpretable models, and generate

               medication to an initial, ineffective antidepressant drug, no
               randomized controlled trial has compared the efficacy of this
               approach. METHODS: We randomly assigned 565 adult outpatients who
               had nonpsychotic major depressive disorder without remission
               despite a mean of 11.9 weeks of citalopram therapy (mean final
               dose, 55 mg per day) to receive sustained-release bupropion (at a
               dose of up to 400 mg per day) as augmentation and 286 to receive
               buspirone (at a dose of up to 60 mg per day) as augmentation. The
               primary outcome of remission of symptoms was defined as a score
               of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
               (HRSD-17) at the end of this study; scores were obtained over the
               telephone by raters blinded to treatment assignment. The 16-item
               Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology--Self-Report
               (QIDS-SR-16) was used to determine the secondary outcomes of
               remission (defined as a score of less than 6 at the end of this
               study) and response (a reduction in baseline scores of 50 percent
               or more). RESULTS: The sustained-release bupropion group and the
               buspirone group had similar rates of HRSD-17 remission (29.7
               percent and 30.1 percent, respectively), QIDS-SR-16 remission
               (39.0 percent and 32.9 percent), and QIDS-SR-16 response (31.8
               percent and 26.9 percent). Sustained-release bupropion, however,
               was associated with a greater reduction (from baseline to the end
               of this study) in QIDS-SR-16 scores than was buspirone (25.3
               percent vs. 17.1 percent, P<0.04), a lower QIDS-SR-16 score at
               the end of this study (8.0 vs. 9.1, P<0.02), and a lower dropout
               rate due to intolerance (12.5 percent vs. 20.6 percent, P<0.009).
               CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation of citalopram with either
               sustained-release bupropion or buspirone appears to be useful in
               actual clinical settings. Augmentation with sustained-release
               bupropion does have certain advantages, including a greater
               reduction in the number and severity of symptoms and fewer side
               effects and adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,

               large set of 74 808 annotations was curated across 272 discharge
               notes spanning 6624 unique clinical concepts. Submissions were
               evaluated using the mean Intersection-over-Union metric,
               evaluated at the character level with the 3 best performing
               solutions awarded a cash prize. RESULTS: The winning solutions
               employed contrasting approaches: a dictionary-based method, an
               encoder-based method, and a decoder-based method. DISCUSSION: Our
               analysis reveals that concept frequency in training data
               significantly impacts model performance, with rare concepts
               proving particularly challenging. High concept entropy and
               annotation ambiguity were also associated with decreased

               future projects should focus on improving entity linking for rare
               concepts and developing methods to better leverage contextual
               information when training examples are scarce.",

               with mental disorders and examine differences in mortality risks
               by type of death, diagnosis, and study characteristics. DATA
               SOURCES: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of
               Science from inception through May 7, 2014, including references
               of eligible articles. Our search strategy included terms for
               mental disorders (eg, mental disorders, serious mental illness,
               and severe mental illness), specific diagnoses (eg,
               schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), and
               mortality. We also used Google Scholar to identify articles that
               cited eligible articles. STUDY SELECTION: English-language cohort
               studies that reported a mortality estimate of mental disorders
               compared with a general population or controls from the same
               study setting without mental illness were included. Two reviewers
               independently reviewed the titles, abstracts, and articles. Of
               2481 studies identified, 203 articles met the eligibility
               criteria and represented 29 countries in 6 continents. DATA
               EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One reviewer conducted a full
               abstraction of all data, and 2 reviewers verified accuracy. MAIN
               OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality estimates (eg, standardized
               mortality ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and
               years of potential life lost) comparing people with mental
               disorders and the general population or people without mental
               disorders. We used random-effects meta-analysis models to pool
               mortality ratios for all, natural, and unnatural causes of death.
               We also examined years of potential life lost and estimated the
               population attributable risk of mortality due to mental
               disorders. RESULTS: For all-cause mortality, the pooled relative
               risk of mortality among those with mental disorders (from 148
               studies) was 2.22 (95\% CI, 2.12-2.33). Of these, 135 studies
               revealed that mortality was significantly higher among people
               with mental disorders than among the comparison population. A
               total of 67.3\% of deaths among people with mental disorders were
               due to natural causes, 17.5\% to unnatural causes, and the
               remainder to other or unknown causes. The median years of
               potential life lost was 10 years (n = 24 studies). We estimate
               that 14.3\% of deaths worldwide, or approximately 8 million
               deaths each year, are attributable to mental disorders.
               CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These estimates suggest that mental
               disorders rank among the most substantial causes of death
               worldwide. Efforts to quantify and address the global burden of
               illness need to better consider the role of mental disorders in
               preventable mortality.",

               primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training
               data. At the same time, models' inference capabilities have
               increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether
               current LLMs could violate individuals' privacy by inferring
               personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this
               work, we present the first comprehensive study on the
               capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from
               text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles,
               and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal
               attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to $85\%$
               top-1 and $95\%$ top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost
               ($100\times$) and time ($240\times$) required by humans. As

               privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information

               mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are
               currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM
               inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer

                   but relatively little efforts have been dedicated to
                   designing scalable classical Machine Learning (ML) models
                   providing DP guarantees. In this work we describe and
                   implement a DP fork of a battle tested ML model: XGBoost. Our
                   approach beats by a large margin previous attempts at the
                   task, in terms of accuracy achieved for a given privacy
                   budget. It is also the only DP implementation of boosted
                   trees that scales to big data and can run in distributed
                   environments such as: Kubernetes, Dask or Apache Spark.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to identify genetic markers for
               antidepressant medication intolerance. Genetic variation in drug
               metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has
               been postulated to underlie antidepressant intolerance
               (pharmacokinetic effect). However, variation in genes encoding
               serotonin receptors could also explain antidepressant side
               effects (pharmacodynamic effect). METHOD: An 8-week,
               double-blind, randomized pharmacogenetic study compared the
               widely prescribed antidepressants paroxetine (a selective
               serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) and mirtazapine (not an
               SSRI) in 246 elderly patients with major depression. Genotypes
               were determined for the 102 T/C single nucleotide polymorphism
               (SNP) in the serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) locus (HTR2A), previously
               associated with psychotropic medication treatment outcome.
               Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to extensively characterize
               variation in the CYP2D6 gene. Clinical outcomes included
               treatment discontinuations, adverse events, medication
               compliance, and change in mood. RESULTS: Survival analysis showed
               discontinuations due to paroxetine-induced side effects were
               strongly associated with the HTR2A C/C genotype. There was a
               significant linear relationship between the number of C alleles
               and the probability of discontinuation. Side effect severity in
               paroxetine-treated patients with the C/C genotype was also
               greater. In contrast, HTR2A 102 T/C genotype had no effect on
               mirtazapine side effects. CYP2D6 genotype did not predict
               treatment outcome for either medication. CONCLUSIONS:
               Pharmacodynamic differences among patients due to variant
               5-HT(2A) receptors appear to be more important than
               pharmacokinetic variation in determining paroxetine intolerance.
               Pharmacogenetic markers may be useful in predicting
               antidepressant treatment outcome.",

               health-related behaviors associated with positive outcomes. We
               aimed to identify classes of US adults with distinct digital
               technologies access and health use patterns and characterize
               class composition. Data came from Health Information National
               Trends Survey Wave 5 Cycles 1-4, a nationally representative
               cross-sectional survey of US adults (N=13,993). We used latent
               class analysis to identify digital technologies access and health
               use patterns based on 32 ternary variables of behaviors and
               access to requisite technologies and platforms, including the
               internet, internet-enabled devices, health monitors, and
               electronic health records (EHRs). We ran a multinomial logistic
               regression to identify sociodemographic and health correlates of
               class membership (n=10,734). Results: Ten classes captured
               patterns of digital technology access and health use among US
               adults. This included a digitally isolated, a mobile-dependent,
               and a super user class, which made up 8.9\%, 7.8\%, and 13.6\% of
               US adults, respectively, and captured access patterns from only
               basic cellphones and health monitors to near complete access to
               web-, mobile-, and EHR-based platforms. Half of US adults
               belonged to classes that lacked access to EHRs and relied on
               alternative web-based tools typical of patient portals. The
               proportion of class members who used digital technologies for
               health purposes varied from small to large. Older and less
               educated adults had lower odds of belonging to classes
               characterized by access or engagement in health behaviors.
               Hispanic and Asian adults had higher odds of belonging to the
               mobile-dependent class. Individuals without a regular healthcare
               provider and those who had not visited a provider in the past
               year were more likely to belong to classes with limited digital
               technologies access or health use. Discussion: Only one third of
               US adults belonged to classes that had near complete access to
               digital technologies and whose members engaged in almost all
               health behaviors examined. Sex, age, and education were
               associated with membership in classes that lacked access to 1+
               digital technologies or exhibited none to limited health uses of
               such technologies. Results can guide efforts to improve access
               and health use of digital technologies to maximize associated
               health benefits and minimize disparities.",

               Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study

               determine which of several treatments are the most effective
               ``next-steps'' for patients with major depressive disorder whose
               symptoms do not remit or who cannot tolerate an initial treatment
               and, if needed, ensuing treatments. Entry criteria were broadly
               defined and inclusive, and patients were enrolled from
               psychiatric and primary care clinics. All participants began on
               citalopram and were managed by clinic physicians, who followed an
               algorithm-guided acute-phase treatment through five visits over
               12 weeks. At the end of each sequence, patients whose depression
               had not fully remitted were eligible for subsequent randomized
               trials in a sequence of up to three clinical trials. In general,
               remission rates in the study clinics were lower than expected,
               suggesting the need for several steps to achieve remission for
               most patients. There was no clear medication ``winner'' for
               patients whose depression did not remit after one or more
               aggressive medication trials. Both switching and augmenting
               appeared to be reasonable options when an initial antidepressant
               treatment failed, although these two strategies could not be
               directly compared. Further, the likelihood of remission after two
               vigorous medication trials substantially decreased, and remission
               would likely require more complicated medication regimens for
               which the existing evidence base is quite thin. STAR*D
               demonstrated that inclusion of more real-world patients in
               clinical trials is both feasible and informative. Policy
               implications of the findings, as well as the study's limitations,
               are discussed.",
