#### What is this project about?

Medication therapy, along with psychotherapy, is effective and widely utilized for the treatment of anxiety and depression disorders. Unfortunately, no single medication is universally effective, and many patients suffer from a harmful trial-and-error process to find the right medication.

Our project aims to develop explainable machine learning models for medication choice from large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, and integrate those models into useful and usable interfaces, with interpretation of the results contextualized by generative AI for clinical audiences.

By combining the strengths of traditional machine learning approaches with the unique interaction and information processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we believe we can help clinicians and patients find the right treatment faster, with far less suffering and cost.

<br />

#### How large of a problem is medication choice for anxiety and depression?

This issue and its impacts are massive. Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders worldwide, affecting an estimated 279 and 458 million individuals respectively as of 2019 {% cite Wang2025-tq,Zhang2025-yf %}. These diseases take a significant toll, impacting physical health, financial wellbeing, and life expectancy {% cite Wang2025-tq,Walker2015-kk %}.

Along with psychotherapy, medication therapy is considered an effective first-line treatment, with over 8.8 million in the UK alone prescribed an antidepressant {% cite NHS-Business-Services-Authority2025-mv %}. Unfortunately, no single medication, or even class of medications, is universally appropriate {% cite Trivedi2006-gx %}. Initial prescriptions are frequently ineffective, with upwards of 55% of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients not responding, and estimates for medication switches up to 40% {% cite Mars2017-kd %}. 

Our own preliminary analysis bears this out: across a cohort of patients in the AllOfUs dataset {% cite UnknownUnknown-oy %} with an initial diagnosis of anxiety or depression and subsequent medication, 48% switched or supplemented with additional medications at a later date, and 24% did so more than once. The diversity of initial and subsequent prescriptions and classes illustrates just how little information is available to guide treatment choices:

{% include figure.html img="sankey.png" alt="Sankey Diagram of Medication Pathways" caption="Figure 1: Prescription patterns after an initial anxiety and/or depression diagnosis in the AllOfUs cohort. Of 123,010 patients prescribed medication, 48% percent modified (switched or augmented) at a later date, 24% did so more than once. Preliminary data; top 10 medications and up to 2 modifications shown for clarity." %}

Patients often switch or modify medications due to adverse side effects; as illustrated by Campos et al. \cite{Campos2021-yh}, these range from mild symptoms such as dry mouth and runny nose to severe, including suicidal ideation:

{% include figure.html width="60%" img="side-effects.png" alt="Common Side Effects of Anxiety and Depression Medications" caption="Figure 2: Common side effects for medications often prescribed for anxiety or depression, courtesy Campos et al. 2021 (Campos et al., 2021), highlighting the diversity of adverse reactions across medications ranging from minor (runny nose, dry mouth) to severe (suicidal thoughts and attempts)." %}

**Simply put, helping patients and clinicians identify effective medications with less trial-and-error would eliminate a tremendous amount of human suffering.**


<br />

#### Can you really predict which medications will work best?

Yes! Genetics, age, sex, and other patient-specific features are increasingly recognized influences \cite{Murphy2003-zi,Thase2005-sf}, suggesting a role for personalized therapeutic choices. Indeed, recent applications have shown promise in predicting medication outcomes in psychiatry, and for depression specifically \cite{Chekroud2021-ft,Elbakary2025-zu,Sheu2023-js}.

Our own preliminary analyses support this hypothesis as well: using the same data as above, we modeled the probability of switching or augmenting based on patient demographic and risk factors, revealing that levels of stress, companionship, and choice of medication class influences likelihood of a change in medication regime:

{% include figure.html width="50%" img="coeffs.png" alt="Forest Plot of Basic Logistic Regression Model Predicting Switching or Augmenting" caption="Figure 3: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for factors predicting medication switch or augmentation relative to baseline rates for Male patients prescribed an SSRI. Stress, companionship, and medication class influence baseline modification rates. Preliminary data (same as Figure 1, N=123,010)." %}

Models like these provide general information useful for all patients, but personalized, patient-specific predictions are also possible with modern machine learning approaches. In these settings, “explainable” machine learning provides individual-level information that can help guide decision making, and previous literature has applied these and similar methods to medication decision making \cite{Abbas2025-uf}. We are experienced in these and related methods via work in mental health and other disease contexts \cite{Hurwitz2025-sh,Hurwitz2025-vu,Pfaff2023-ap,McInnis2025-qx,Coleman2024-id}.

{% include figure.html width="90%" img="force_plot.png" alt="Example Force Plot Providing Individual-Level Explanations" caption="Figure 4: Example “force plot” illustrating how Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide per-patient information influencing predictions. Such ‘explainable predictions’ can inform decision making, but their interpretability is limited for non-specialists. Large Language Models can close this interpretability gap, serving to summarize and contextualize model results for clinical application. Mock data shown for illustrative purposes." %}

<br />

#### Why has no one done this yet? Where does AI fit in?

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) designed to facilitate decision making are not a new idea, including those that integrate predictions based on patient data, but few have seen widespread use. Several studies have identified a number of factors influencing their acceptability in practice, including systems’ respect for clinician autonomy, features such as data visualization, customization and scenario exploration, and usability factors such as when and how information is presented \cite{Bayor2025-je,Bologva2016-iw,Wang2023-bw}. 

A significant barrier to adoption is the amount and complexity of information provided, especially when predictive models are integrated. While clinicians report increased trust in systems that transparently report methods and evaluations \cite{Jacobs2021-py}, most are not trained in advanced machine learning or biostatistical techniques. CDSS that integrate explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME provide even more detailed information, but technical explainability should not be confused with clinical interpretability, especially in clinical settings when employed by non-experts \cite{Petch2022-dk}.

Generative AI provides new opportunities to develop better user interfaces, integrating explainable predictive models as ‘tools’ that agentic AI can call and interpret, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for incorporation of other data and care guidelines, and novel assistive functions via turn-based and other engagement types \cite{Luera2024-ui}. LLMs can also effectively interpret and contextualize complex predictive model outputs \cite{Bordt2024-oj}, serving as a ‘data scientist in the room’ engaging with clinicians, patients, data, and documentation together.

In usability studies, providers report a desire for customization, ‘what if’ scenario explorations, just-in-time information, and rapid interactions \cite{Bayor2025-je,Bologva2016-iw,Wang2023-bw}. Related features supported by generative AI interfaces include:

* Custom instructions, for example to instruct avoiding medications not available at a particular clinic.
* Data and predictive results interpretation, contextualized with other available data and established care guidelines.
* On-demand information via text-based interfaces and UI components triggered by LLM responses.
* Suggested contextual follow-up questions based on patient context and data
* Automatic logging for auditability and accountability.

#### De-identified EHR data seems like a great resource. What other sources of patient information might be useful?

Clinical data come in several forms, one of which is **structured** data, typically represented by demographic information (e.g. age, sex) and medical ‘codes’ for features like conditions (e.g. ICD10 F31.1, Major Depressive Disorder), prescriptions (e.g. RxNorm 283672, Citalopram 10mg Oral Tablet), or procedures (e.g. CPT 90837, Individual Psychotherapy, 60 minutes). 

Another is **clinical notes**, free-text entered by clinicians or assistants during the course of care; SOAP notes for example capture Subjective and Objective patient features, an overall Assessment, and care Plan in paragraph form.

Coded, structured data has several advantages for understanding and predicting patient experience:

* It allows for precise and sophisticated querying, for example to search “all patients with any type of anxiety diagnosis comorbid with any type of depression diagnosis within 2 weeks, followed by administration of escitalopram for at least 6 weeks.”
* Its tabular format supports a wide variety of modeling techniques, including biostatistical (cohort matching, survival analyses) machine learning (e.g. XGBoost, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines), and post-hoc explainability methods (e.g. Shapley Additive exPlanations, SHAP, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, LIME).
* It is efficient, in the sense of representing a large amount of information in a small amount of text, an important factor when utilizing language models with limited context windows for summarization or other tasks. 
* It is fully de-identified, unlike notes which are difficult to guarantee free of personally identifiable information thus risking patient privacy. 

However, **structured data typically available for research use misses detailed information available in notes**. This is not because this information is not codable; the SNOMED medical vocabulary for example contains codes for millions of concepts, including social and related risk factors (e.g. 301887005, Needs Assistance at Home), common and rare adverse drug reactions (240091000000105, Blurred Vision), and much more. Rather, medical coding is a time consuming manual process, and typically only information useful for billing is captured in the US. The UK fares somewhat better in general practice, but less so in specialty clinics \cite{Tayefi2021-vi,Wilson2018-xr}. As a result, readily-available structured data is not as complete as it could be. 

We’ll use LLMs to enhance structured data by processing, de-identifying, and coding concepts from free-text clinical notes, focusing on risk factors, treatments, and outcomes for anxiety and depression. This will require careful and ethical selection of a set of patient notes, and manual coding for evaluation purposes by trained human scribes.

We have developed a pilot note-coding pipeline on mock data using an agent-based approach inspired by the manual coding process. Here, an LLM agent is provided with tools to 1) identify spans of text representing codable concepts, including negations (for e.g. ‘patient denies’ annotations), 2) search for medical concepts using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach guided by embeddings appropriate for short clinical text \cite{Excoffier2024-cd}, and 3) suggest alternative phrasings and consider more- and less-specific codes by navigating the medical hierarchy. Our initial implementation generates a full report for auditability and can be run in graphical or “batch” mode for large-scale processing in a secure compute environment. 

{% include figure.html width="100%" img="extract_gui.png" alt="Medical Concept Coding Extraction GUI" caption="Figure 6: Pilot pipeline translating free-text clinical notes to structured medical concept codes, available as a graphical user interface (shown) or batch-processor for use in secure environments. The resulting additional ‘structured’ data enriches quantifiable measurements of experiences and outcomes, contributes to model performance, and enhances patient privacy in research. This agent-based pipeline employs a multi-step approach based on human annotation processes." %}


Ultimately, performing this process on notes for a diverse cohort of patients with anxiety and depression will provide several benefits:

* We will better quantify the experiences of patients with more detailed data suitable for large-scale exploratory data analyses or unsupervised clustering techniques (see below). 
* We will enhance patient privacy in research by publishing our extraction and de-identification methods for use in other contexts.
* We will enhance the accuracy of predictive models for medication choice with improved data depth and breadth.

#### How are you incorporating lived experiences of those with Anxiety and Depression?

Our project idea was driven by a shared realization that several of our team members have lived experience with medications for anxiety and/or depression, with a consistent theme of diverse side effects impacting our personal and professional lives, lack of or loss of effectiveness over time, trials, and cross-tapers, despite eventual relief. We informally confirmed this as a common experience with others and clinical colleagues in psychiatry, but to ensure independent viewpoint integration, we will include those with lived experience as a primary role throughout the project. Via outreach to our local chapter of the National Alliance for Mental Health (NAMI) we have invited Said Alhassan, board of directors member and patient advocate with lived experience, as a full team member. His input has been instrumental in discussions of access to psychiatric medications, frustrations in identifying effective therapies, and development of community engagement sessions for broader input, in addition to contributing to technical discussions and strategic vision.

Our team additionally includes a practicing psychiatrist, Dr. Danielle Lowe, with extensive experiential knowledge in prescribing and patient care. In collaboration with other team members, we will convene a **Community Advisory Board (CAB)** consisting of clinicians with inpatient, outpatient, psychiatric and general practitioner experience, and patients with lived experience including both treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant anxiety and depression. For the latter, we will recruit through advocacy organizations including the NAMI national organization, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, and the LiveWell Foundation, striving to recruit CAB members who are engaged with patient advocacy in their respective organizations to promote broad perspectives.

Using accelerator funds we have engaged with the UNC Patient and Community Engagement (PaCER) center to facilitate community engagement sessions, laying the groundwork for the CAB and early research priorities via journey-mapping exercises with both patients and prescribers. 

{% include figure.html width="100%" img="journey_mapping.png" alt="Journey-Mapping Exercises with Clinicians and Patients" caption="Figure 7: In the course of care, clinicians and patients engage in shared decision making based on symptom presentation, patient characteristics, and clinician experience. While some of this information is objective (e.g. co-occurring conditions, medication interactions), other information is subjective (e.g. clinician and patient preferences). Journey mapping exercises with both groups provide insight on the collaborative process at key decision points and will guide model and tool development." %}

Finally, members of the CAB will be invited to review preliminary results, suggest revisions, and be invited as co-authors to publications in relevant medical informatics journals, a strategy we have successfully employed with Long COVID lived experience experts and patient advocacy groups \cite{O-Neil2024-gq,McCorkell2021-am}.

#### Can you find and use novel patterns in large-scale data to better understand anxiety and depression?

Yes, large-scale EHR data provides detailed information across millions of patients, enabling a broad range of data mining techniques that can reveal previously known trends or patterns. Applicable methods are many, including clustering, timeseries analyses, dimensionality reduction, visualization, latent variable techniques, and more \cite{Yadav2018-xc}.

Some techniques provide a degree of interpretability; for example principle components or latent class analyses for population-level trends \cite{Hegeman2024-kr}, or probabilistic methods such as LDA which report comorbidity distributions \cite{Mustakim2021-ae}. Semi-supervised or combined methods can utilize cluster-like information for predictions, or relate patterns to other known patient information. For example, we developed a novel method to associate LDA-based comorbidity clusters with patient outcomes (e.g. to identify novel presentations of Long COVID) or demographic factors such as age and sex:

{% include figure.html width="45%" img="cluster.png" alt="Clustering Patient Features" caption="Figure 8: Top: one cluster (of 300) identified in an analysis of 9M+ patient condition comorbidities reveals associations between anxiety and depression disorders, insomnia, and other patient factors. Conditions are sized by relative prevalence, and colored by relative strength of cluster association. Below: female patients and adults are more strongly associated with this cluster than males, children, or seniors. Similar techniques may be applied to other patient factors such as medication status or outcome. Based on O’Neil et al. 2024 \cite{O-Neil2024-gq}." %}
