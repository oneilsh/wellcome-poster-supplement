# Extract, Predict, Support: Improving Medication Choice and Outcomes from Clinical Data to Decision Support


**We aim to help prescribers and patients identify effective medication therapies for anxiety and depression faster and with less trial and error.** Integrating generative AI interfaces and explainable machine learning, we leverage vast amounts of health information to make data-informed decisions for each individual, while respecting both clinician expertise and patient autonomy. We extract, de-identify, and incorporate relevant information only available in sensitive clinical notes, improving prediction accuracy and better quantifying patient experiences while enhancing privacy in precision medicine.
